# Future Improvements Ideas

- Implement a GUI using Java Swing
- better structure of different classes & packages
- Add file storage or database integration
    > stored the data in the array users first
    > in the future the data should be safed in a sql-database (JDBC)
    > export the data in a .csv file should be possible

- Introduce authentication and role-based access

- Write unit tests with JUnit
