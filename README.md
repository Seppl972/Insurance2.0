# Insurance Management System – Java Project (GUI)

Welcome to my first coding project for solving real world problems! This Java-based application is designed to simulate basic processes within an insurance company. It serves as a practical application of object-oriented programming and software engineering concepts I have learned during my studies.

## 🚀 Project Goals

- Demonstrate learned oop principles in a real-life context  
- Apply Java advanced skills in a project for faster learning progress
- Learning to create an advanced Java GUI application 
- Learning to setup an Connection with a SQL database with JDBC

## 🛠️ Features

- Login Window
- Manage customer profiles
- Advanced java.swing GUI interface
- Connection with JDBC to a SQL-Database

## 📚 Technologies Used

- Java 17+
- VSCode (for development)
- DBeaver for SQL Management
- Git for version control

## 💡 Learned Concepts in Practice

- Object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Advanced GUI skills with Java.swing (e.g.,)
   > done
- Implementing JTable for creating structured user data
   > done
- Connecting a SQL-Database with JDBC for data management
   > in progress

## 📦 How to Run
